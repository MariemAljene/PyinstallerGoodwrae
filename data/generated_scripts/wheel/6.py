It seems like you are asking for a python script in version 3.9 which uses the wheel library, as well as other libraries such as mock, numpy, pytorch lightning and torch in order to implement certain functions centered around the concept of a wheel such as 'allowing rotational motion', 'energy conversion (as in water wheels)' and 'supporting structure of vehicles'. 

However, it's important to understand that Python doesn't process physical concepts in the bare form. It might be unclear what exactly you're referring to when you mention those concepts, as well as how you would like to use these concepts in context of the provided code. We cannot directly implement these physical properties, but we can abstract these concepts into the mathematical model or shape the output according to these criteria.

The provided code deals with implementing a simple neural network architecture that predicts 3 outputs that are then used to calculate the loss for the neural network during its training and validation phases. This code is then tested using unittest's TestCase.

Instead, if you provide more details about the datasets with specific input and output, or alignment of these physical concepts ('allowing rotational motion', 'energy conversion (as in water wheels)', 'supporting structure of vehicles') into data representation or processing model, will make it possible to incorporate these in the existing code.
