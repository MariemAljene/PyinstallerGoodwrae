Your request to include wheel library is not very clear, as wheel is a built-in Python package used to build Python distributions. However, I will include it for you.

Based on what Python version you are using, you may need to install the libraries if not already installed. Here is your Python script:

```
import numpy as np
import pytorch_lightning as pl
from pytorch_lightning import Trainer
from torch.utils.data import Dataset, DataLoader
import torch
from unittest import TestCase, main as unittest_main
from unittest.mock import patch, MagicMock
from torch.nn import functional as F

# Import wheel library
import wheel

class RandomDataset(Dataset):
    
  def __init__(self, size, length):
    self.length = length
    self.data = torch.randn(length, size)

  def __getitem__(self, index):
    return self.data[index]

  def __len__(self):
    return self.length

# Data generation
size = 2
length = 1000
dataset = RandomDataset(size, length)
train, test = torch.utils.data.random_split(dataset, [800, 200])
train_loader = DataLoader(dataset=train, batch_size=100)
test_loader = DataLoader(dataset=test, batch_size=100)

class Model(pl.LightningModule):
    
  def __init__(self):
    super(Model, self).__init__()
    self.layer = torch.nn.Linear(2, 2)

  def forward(self, x):
    return self.layer(x)

  def compute_loss(self, batch):
    loss = F.mse_loss(self(batch), batch)
    return loss

  def training_step(self, batch, batch_nb):
    loss = self.compute_loss(batch)
    result = pl.TrainResult(minimize=loss)
    result.log('train_loss', loss)
    return result

  def validation_step(self, batch, batch_nb):
    loss = self.compute_loss(batch)
    result = pl.EvalResult(checkpoint_on=loss)
    result.log('val_loss', loss)
    return result

  def configure_optimizers(self):
    return torch.optim.Adam(self.parameters(), lr=0.02)

  def train_dataloader(self):
    return train_loader

  def val_dataloader(self):
    return test_loader


class TestModel(TestCase):
    
  @patch('__main__.Model', autospec=True)
  def test_model(self, mock_model):
    trainer = Trainer(max_epochs=1, fast_dev_run=True)
    instance = mock_model.return_value
    trainer.fit(instance)
    self.assertTrue(mock_model.called)
    mock_model.assert_called_once_with()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    model = Model()
    trainer = Trainer(max_epochs=100)
    trainer.fit(model)
    unittest_main()
```

Not that the function to test is `fast_dev_run`. This is a debugging feature of PyTorch lightning that runs through a single batch from each loader to check for any errors.

Note: The given script may contain over 100 lines if I am to include functioning code representing 'contributing to the working of several technologies (like conveyor belts, pottery wheels, pulley systems)', 'assembling various types of vehicles', 'energy conversion (as in water wheels)', which you mentioned. However, these are very broad and complex tasks, that may require extensive code to implement properly. This script only covers a basic machine learning implementation using PyTorch Lightning.
