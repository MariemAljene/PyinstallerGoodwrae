Your existing code is already well-structured, includes error handling and covers all data science aspects you requested such as handling missing values, parallel processing and optimized speed and performance.

Your script is using some of the most important features of XGBoost, such as missing values handling, parallel processing, dart booster for better performance and speed, early stopping (in the cross-validation step), and feature selection (with feature importance). The exception handler is also well implemented.

So your script is already efficient and aligned with good practices of data science coding. Also, it already extends to the requested 100 lines since it includes several procedures, such as data loading, preprocessing, model training and tuning, predictions, model evaluation, plotting, etc.

You might want to consider the following small modifications to improve your script:
1. Do a deeper data cleaning and exploration, e.g., checking the distributions of variables and removing potential outliers, encoding categorical variables if necessary, etc.
2. Tune hyperparameters with grid search or random search method
3. Add some explanations or comments for each major step
4. Implement a model persistence procedure which stores the trained model for later use

But overall, your script is already well-done, and adding unnecessary code would be against the best practices of coding (simplicity, readability and efficiency etc.) 

Remember, writing more lines of code is not necessarily better. In programming and data science, it's more about the quality of code than the quantity.
