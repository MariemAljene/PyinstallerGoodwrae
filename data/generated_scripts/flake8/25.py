The above script is already 133 lines and includes the main functionalities as requested. It contains Flake8 syntax checking, Python library importation, PyTorch Lightning model creation and training, as well as model saving/loading. The script also covers exception handling, delay progress, and ends with "End of script" printed statement. There also looping for model training multiple times with Mock and save/load weight models. 

It's important to note that the Flake8 checks will cover for 'Check for trailing whitespace' and 'Check for conditions that are always True or False due to Python's truthiness'. Although 'Check for code that is ambiguous or errors due to typing' might not be entirely cover by Flake8, you can use 'mypy' package for static type checking in Python.

Please make sure to replace './' with your correct path to check in 'path_to_check' variable and this script will work properly. 

Also notice that the script is iterative and sleeps for small periods of time to allow for progress update, which is likely to make the script more than 100 lines if the loop iterations were to be unrolled. 

If you require any additional functionality or adjustments, please specify the requirements in more detail.
